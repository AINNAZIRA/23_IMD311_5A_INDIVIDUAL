            <p>The UiTM equivalent of a best buddy. Wan Ili Afiqah from Kuantan, Pahang, Siti Norfatihah from Machang, Kelantan, Nur Liyana Syafiqah from Kuala Krai, Kelantan, and Nor Tihani from Tanah Merah, Kelantan are my closest friends. We've known since the first week of Diploma on 2022. I didn't think we'd be this close till now, and I'm grateful to have met them. Inseparable is the best way to describe us. Together we do our homework, we eat our meals, and we hang out. We always get together when we're both in UiTM. We love to go shopping at Kota Bharu Mall and then to Boat Noodle for a meal whenever we get the chance. On weekends, we like to unwind by going out with friends. We've been apart for a while now, and I'm really starting to miss my girls. I long for the times we spent together.</p>

            <p>Other than that, I also get to friends with them who is, Amalin Alya from Kuala Krai, Kelantan, Syahidatul Aminah from Pasir Mas, Kelantan and Amirah Syahirah from Machang, Kelantan. I get to know them in a short time but it's really precious memories for me. We were also able to be roommates for 6 months which was last semester, and it was very precious to me even though it was only for a short time. I also miss to being with them.</p>
